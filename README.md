# Rust Sudoku Solver
Just trying a few different algorithms to try and solve it as fast as possible.
For testing I'm using [3 million sudoku puzzles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radcliffe/3-million-sudoku-puzzles-with-ratings/data) from Kaggle. These are all solved within 2 minutes with an average duration of 37 Â± 65.86 ms.

## Usage
```bash
cargo run --quiet --release
```
